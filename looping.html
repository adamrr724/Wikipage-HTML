    <h1> Looping </h1>
    <p> Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.</p>
    <p>
      There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
